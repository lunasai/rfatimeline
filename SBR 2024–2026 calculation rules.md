SBR 2024–2026 calculation rules

1. Redundancy Pay Formula

Formula: A × B × C

A = Weighted service years:

up to age 35 → 0.5 per year

35–45 → 1 per year

45–55 → 1.5 per year

55+ → 2 per year

Periods under 6 months round down; over 6 months round up.

B = Gross monthly income (monthly salary + 8% holiday allowance).

C = 1

Includes statutory transition allowance (not paid in addition).

Maximum €300,000 gross.

If total yearly income > €300,000, payment is capped at the statutory transition fee.

Compensation cannot exceed expected loss of income until pension age (AOW).

Any unemployment or social benefit payments are deducted.

2. Outplacement Rules

Duration:

<50 years old or <20 years of service → 4 months

≥50 years or ≥20 years of service → 6 months

During outplacement: employee keeps salary and must focus fully on job search.

Early success: if a new job is found before the end of the period → compensation still based on formula, with early termination allowed.

Return guarantee: if new job ends during probation (through no fault), employee can return and continue outplacement.

3. Additional Compensation

If employee does not use outplacement:

4-month outplacement → +2 months’ salary

6-month outplacement → +3 months’ salary

If employee leaves earlier than the planned outplacement period → gets 50% of one month’s salary per remaining full month.

4. Retirement Scheme (Age 61–64)

For employees 61+ with ≥10 years of service:

Option to receive 80% of gross monthly income (plus 100% of old-age allowance, if applicable) until age 64.

Participation in this scheme excludes normal outplacement and redundancy compensation.

Pension and health insurance remain partly covered until 64.

Earnings from new work are deducted (up to 75%).

5. Caps and Exceptions

Minimum severance = at least statutory transitional fee (unless RVU tax risk applies).

No increase in compensation if outplacement was suspended (e.g., maternity or illness).

Changes in law trigger consultation with trade unions.
